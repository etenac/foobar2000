The fifth full length album by the British extreme metal band, released June 1996 by Earache Records. Recorded & mixed between Feb. and April 1995 at Battery Studios and during Feb. 1995 at Rockfield Studios.
 There was a special edition 2CD press in 1996 with disc 1 (the album) shaped like a brain, and the second disc had a bonus track Emotional Flatline and Go To hell because they wouldn't fit on the shaped CD. The album was remastered and re-released in 2008 with a bonus track Death Rider Da (also on the 1998 Japanese edition) and a DVD titled 'The Pathologist's Report Part V' which is a 30-minute behind the scenes documentary about the album.
