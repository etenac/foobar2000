Reek of Putrefaction is the debut album by British extreme metal band Carcass. It was released by Earache Records in July 1988. It is regarded as the very first goregrind album, a musical genre with lyrical focus on grotesque medical and pathological images as opposed to the political themes found in most grindcore bands.
