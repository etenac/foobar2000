Released in 2002, Sons of Northern Darkness is the seventh album by the Norwegian black metal band Immortal. Musically, it continues the blackened thrash metal style heard the two previous releases At the Heart of Winter and Damned in Black with even more modern and polished production. This was the band's first release on Nuclear Blast Records. The bassist, Iscariah, who only played bass on One By One, left the band shortly before the album was released, and the band broke up the following year. They reformed in 2007.

The album was released in multiple formats; initially on Jewelcase CD, a limited edition four-panel digipak CD, a limited edition metal box CD, a picture disc LP, & a gatefold double LP.
 In 2005 it was reissued as a "Deluxe Edition" digipak CD with bonus live DVD, in 2007 as four 10" vinyls in a leather box, and in 2008 on gatefold double LP on Back On Black records.
The limited edition metal box was only available via Nuclear Blast mailorder and was sold out on preorder.

All lyrics written by Demonaz, all music composed by Abbath and Horgh.
