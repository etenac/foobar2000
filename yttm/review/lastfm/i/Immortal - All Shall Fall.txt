All Shall Fall is the eighth studio album by the Norwegian black metal band, Immortal. The album was released in Europe on September 25, 2009 and the US on October 6, 2009.

In January 2008, Immortal started rehearsing and writing new material for the album. After spending much time performing live that year the band entered both the Grieghallen and Abyss studios in April 2009 to start recording the album. A month later the band already completed recording the album and announced the album's title. In June, Terrorizer was given the opportunity to listen to the just-recorded album and posted an exclusive track-by-track breakdown.
