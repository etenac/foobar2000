Iron Maiden released their 17th Studio album Senjutsu in 2021. It was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studio in early 2019. Senjutsu (Japanese: 戦術, loosely translated as "tactics and strategy") is the seventeenth studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 3 September 2021.

Senjutsu is the band's first studio album in nearly six years, following The Book of Souls (2015), marking the longest gap between two Iron Maiden studio albums. This is also their second double album, and their first studio album since Powerslave (1984) to have no songwriting contributions from guitarist Dave Murray in any way, as well as the first since Virtual XI (1998) to feature multiple songs written by bassist Steve Harris alone.

The name of the album is rendered on the right side of the cover art by the actual vertical Japanese spelling of "senjutsu" (戦術), and on the left side by a font reminiscent of Japanese characters.

Critical reception:
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album has an average score of 86 based on 14 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Wall of Sound scored the album 9/10, calling it an "epic and triumphant return for the lads... better balanced ... with some interesting songwriting".

Senjutsu is one of Iron Maiden's most successful albums, chart-wise, to date peaking at number one in numerous countries such as Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, and marked their first album not to peak that position in the UK charts since A Matter of Life and Death (2006); it did, however, top the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts. The album also gave the band its highest chart position in the US at number three.

Artwork:
The album Senjutsu marks the second use of the band's original logotype (with the extended letters R, M and N) on a studio album cover since The X Factor (1995), the previous one being for The Book of Souls (2015). The album cover by Mark Wilkinson presents Eddie dressed up as a samurai and holding a katana.
