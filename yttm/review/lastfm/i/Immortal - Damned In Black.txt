Damned in Black is the sixth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Immortal. It was released on 27 April 2000 through Osmose Productions. It is the first album where bass guitar is played by Iscariah, the bassist and vocalist of the band Dead to This World. The musical style started to embrace a more blackened thrash metal sound, a style that would be as prevalent on their next album, Sons of Northern Darkness.

It is known that there were five different issues distributed next to the original jewel case: a limited edition digipak, a limited edition picture box case, a special casette tape edition and a limited edition handnumbered vinyl pressing, which was released under Osmose Productions and was later reissued in 2005.

All lyrics written by Demonaz, all music composed by Abbath and Horgh.
