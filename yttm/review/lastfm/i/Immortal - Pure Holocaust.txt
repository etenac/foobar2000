Pure Holocaust is the second album by Norwegian black metal band Immortal. It is generally faster sounding than its predecessor Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism. The lyrics focus mainly on grimness, snow, and Blashyrkh.

Although Grim is credited with drums and appears on the album cover, he does not actually play on the album, with Abbath on drums instead.
