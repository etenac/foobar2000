Powerslave is the fifth studio album by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on September 3, 1984 on EMI in Europe and its sister label Capitol Records in the US (it was re-released by Sanctuary/Columbia Records in the US in 2002). It is notable for its Egyptian theme displayed in the album art, as well in the title track's musical style. It contains a musical re-telling of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", which uses pieces of the original poem as lyrics, and was, for a long time, the longest Iron Maiden song at a length of 13 minutes and 38 seconds (before the band released the "The Book of Souls" album in 2015, featuring the 18-minute epic "Empire of the Clouds"). The album is also notable amongst the band's albums as being the first album to feature the same lineup as the previous one.

"2 Minutes to Midnight" and "Aces High" were released as singles, the former being a staple in nearly all of the band's concert tours.

World Slavery Tour was the tour supporting the album.
