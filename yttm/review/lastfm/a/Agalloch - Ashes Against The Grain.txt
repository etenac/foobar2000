Ashes Against the Grain is an album by American metal band Agalloch under the Brooklyn, New York-based label, The End Records. It is Agalloch's third full-length release, four years after the critically acclaimed The Mantle.

Before the release, the track "Falling Snow" was made available in its entirety on the label's website and on the band's MySpace page. Reports indicate a version of the album was leaked on the web in May 2006.

A pre-release review in the July 2006 issue of Toronto-based Exclaim! magazine described the new album as a "departure and an extension" from the band's previous work:

    The songs tend to move with restraint, as Agalloch's characteristic threads of black metal, folk and ambient sounds coalesce with more doom and art rock.

Three versions of the album were released: a slipcase edition, a deluxe wooden box version (limited to 500 copies) and a vinyl version (limited to 1000 copies).

The vinyl version was released on March 2nd, 2007 through The End Records' Infinite Vinyl Series. It was pressed in three different colors:

        * A clear/orange splatter edition limited to 200 copies.
        * A black edition limited to 400 copies.
        * A clear orange edition limited to 400 copies.

All three vinyl editions include an exclusive bonus track, Scars Of The Shattered Sky (Our Fortress Has Burned To The Ground)
