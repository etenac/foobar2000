Smash is the third studio album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released on April 8, 1994 through Epitaph Records. The album was the band's last collaboration with record producer Thom Wilson, who produced their previous two albums, and also their last release on Epitaph (however, that label released their next album in Europe). Smash met high critical reception upon its release, and is now considered a classic punk rock album by fans, critics, and the band members themselves alike. The album was also responsible for bringing The Offspring to the attention of a mainstream punk audience. Smash was the band's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number four and topped the Heatseeker's chart. Smash produced four hit singles for the band: "Come Out and Play", "Self Esteem", "Gotta Get Away" and the radio-only single "Bad Habit". With sales continuing in the sixteen years since its release, the album has gone on to be certified 6x Platinum in the United States and 4x Platinum in Australia. Although Smash has a dark, punk rock sound, the album is heavily influenced by the emerging pop punk scene. Bands like Green Day and Rancid were gaining popularity, and riding on this wave of popularity, Smash's singles became modern radio rock hits. An example of this was the success of The Offspring's first major single release, "Come Out and Play", which reached #1 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and has become one of the band's signature songs.
