This is the fifth full-length album from Summoning, released in 2001 on Napalm Records. It was the second Summoning album to feature clean vocal, on the chorus of Farewell. It is also their first album to make extensive use of audio samples from radio productions of The Lord of the Rings, giving the album an epic and dramaturgic feeling.
