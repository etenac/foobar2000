The debut album ”Varg & Björn” is a concept album that conveys the notion of human kinds total uselessness and its cyclical attempts – and constant failure – at achieving co-existence with anything on this earth. Civilization is a myth that foreshadows the one and true god; Nature, and the parasitical humans has long since used their right to exist. The punishment is death, and Nature will be the executioner.
