This album is intended to commemorate the countless victims of World War I.

Men were thrown into a differing reality where only survival would count. Death, fear and hunger as a steady companion in the waist-deep trenches filled with mud. One order transferred people into cannon fodder in the human mill - World War I.

The lyrical background of "Menschenmühle" is based on factual reports, letters and other documents from the surviving and deceased soldiers.

Many thanks to my friend Dani B. for providing materials and helping to find a name. Without you this album would not have come about.

The album was written, recorded and produced by Kanonenfieber from September 2020 to January 2021 in the Noisebringer studio.
