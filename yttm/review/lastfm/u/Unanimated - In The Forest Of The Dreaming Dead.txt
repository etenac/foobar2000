(The tracks are incorrectly listed on several editions. With "At Dawn" & "Whispering Shadows" as separate tracks on the remasters, which adds to the confusion.)

Debut album, released on CD & LP in 1993 by No Fashion Records and released in the USA, 1994 on CD with different artwork and layout, by Necropolis Records & Pavement Music. Remastered & reissued 2008 by Regain Records with modified artwork (the back cover art from the No Fashion edition CD is now on the front). Back cover art for the No Fashion edition / front cover of the Regain edition by Daniel Lofthagen (not positive on this but he designed band logos and it's credited to Daniel L).

Correct tracklist is as follows:
1. At Dawn / Whispering Shadows (4:27)
2. Blackness Of The Fallen Star (4:17)
3. Fire Storm (5:28)
4. Storms From The Skies Of Grief (3:38)
5. Through The Gates (3:54)
6. Wind Of A Dismal Past (3:57)
7. Silence Ends (1:35)
8. Mournful Twilight (3:25)
9. In The Forest Of The Dreaming Dead (4:43)
10. Cold Northern Breeze (4:43)
11. Buried Alive (Venom cover) (3:28)
