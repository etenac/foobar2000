The Secrets of the Black Arts is the debut album by Dark Funeral released on January 28, 1996 by No Fashion Records. It was re-released on July 31, 2007 with a bonus disc consisting of the original recording of the album.

The original recording was produced by Dan Swanö at Unisound Studios. According to Blackmoon, he insisted that they re-record the album due to "severely unprofessional production and manner from Mr. Swanö". He continued, "he was overworked and mentally tired when we came to the studio. Also, our then drummer was not playing as good as he should have. So it ended up crap". The rest of the band was satisfied with the recording but Blackmoon refused to release the album with that recording so they decided on infamous Abyss Studio and recorded the album that was eventually released to the public.
