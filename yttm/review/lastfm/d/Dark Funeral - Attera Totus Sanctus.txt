Attera Totus Sanctus (intended Latin translation of "Destroy All the Holy") is Dark Funeral's 4th full length studio album. It was released on October 24, 2005 in Europe through Regain Records, and on November 29, 2005 in the United States through Candlelight Records USA. The title was chosen to convey the band's vehement anti-Right-Hand Path stance. This album also marked the cessation of vocalist Emperor Magus Caligula's role as a bassist for Dark Funeral - both studio and live.
