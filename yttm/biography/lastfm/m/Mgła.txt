Mgła is a black metal project formed in 2000, using rather rough and organic forms of expression within the genre. This is a personal aesthetic preference and conviction that this type of sound can fulfill their vision the best. Conceptual content ranges from nihilism to mysticism and provides comments rather than statements.

Mgła did not perform live for their first 10 years of existence, operating as a studio project only. This changed in 2012 and they've since been performing roughly once per month. A primary reason for playing live is a desire to to perform music in a complete band setting. An attempt was made after Kriegsmaschine essentially became a studio project; roles switched as Kriegsmaschine used to operate as a “band” and Mgła as a “project”. The number of live performances is somewhat limited, yet still significantly larger than originally expected. This is simply due to much higher interest that anticipated. Mgła's live presence is simple to the point of unattractive. They do not use any symbolism or other “hints” how one should interpret their music, as the viewer's most natural response is the most welcome. Everyone is encouraged to think for themselves.
