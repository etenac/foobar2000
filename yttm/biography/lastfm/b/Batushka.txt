Batushka is a Church Slavonic-speaking Polish black metal band. Pronounced "Batjushka", the band's Cyrillic name Батюшка means "father" and is used to address an Eastern Orthodox priest. Their live line-up contains 8 members. Their songs contain lines of liturgical chanting paired with black metal instrumentation. 

The current status of who controls the band is unclear and in legal dispute. In December 2018, both Христофор and Варфоломей claimed they kicked the other one out of Batushka and decided to continue the band separately. For now, there are two versions of the band: Христофор's Батюшка and Варфоломей's Batushka.

In spite of claims by others that they may be blasphemous and anti-Christian, the band is ambiguous about whether they are genuinely religious or not. The band "leaves its audience to decide what it is - black or unblack."
