Heilung is amplified history from early medieval Northern Europe and should not be mistaken for a modern political or religious statement of any kind.

'Heilung' means healing in German, and describes the core of the sound. It is supposed to leave the listener eased and relaxed after a sometimes turbulent musical journey. The lyrics contain original texts from rune stones and preserved spear shafts, amulets and other artifacts. Furthermore poems, which either deal with historical events or are translations/ interpretations of the originals.
