God Dethroned is a blackened death metal band. God Dethroned was formed in 1991 in the Netherlands by lead singer Henri Sattler. After one demo, they released their debut album, The Christhunt (1992), on a tiny German label.

Due to problems with the other band members and the record company, Henri decided to split the band in 1993. He then formed Ministry Of Terror, a thrash metal band, and released Fall of Life with them in 1994. After a European tour Henri left the band and re-formed God Dethroned in 1996.

With new band members and better songs in his back, Henri and the new God Dethroned recorded The Grand Grimoire and inked a deal with Metal Blade. Many successful tours followed in Europe, the U.S. and Japan with great death metal and black metal acts like Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Immortal, and Marduk, just to name a few. In 2006, God Dethroned released The Toxic Touch. In 2009 they released Passiondale with Susan Gerl on guitars.

On February 14th 2011 Henri Sattler announced to call it quits by the end of the year, due to his reluctance to tour. Throughout 2011 the band played a handful of farewell shows, with their final show taking place aboard 70,000 Tons Of Metal in 2012.

In 2014 Henri reactivated the band with the promise of playing select live shows in 2015.
