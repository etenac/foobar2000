Kanonenfieber is a blackened death metal band from Bamberg, Germany. Their debut album 'Menschenmühle' was released on February 20th 2021, and is intended to commemorate the countless victims of World War I.

Behind Kanonenfieber is a young musician from Bamberg who calls himself Noise and deliberately keeps the project anonymous. He lives off a regular 40-hour job, but his passion is music. He devotes most of his free time to this. In the last few years he has built up a small home studio. It was there that the album Menschenmühle was created.

Musically, Menschenmühle serves the Black and Death Metal genre with a dark mood and a lot of melody. A striking feature are the texts in German, which convince critics from abroad with their sometimes brutal lyric poetry.

The idea for Kanonenfieber arose from a discussion with a friend about aspects of the metal scene and how historical topics are implemented. Specifically, it was about the topic of the First World War. As a conclusion, the concept of Menschenmühle was born without glorifying the war, without the Gore aspect, historically accurate and verifiable with facts.

Helpful: The friend is a hobby historian, with a large collection of letters and original documents from the First World War. And it was precisely these reports and letters that served as the basis for the texts.
