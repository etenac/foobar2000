Carcass is an English death metal band from Liverpool, which was formed in 1985. The band has gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist Bill Steer and bassist and vocalist Jeff Walker as the only constant members. They broke up in 1996, but reformed in 2007. To date, the band has released six studio albums, two compilation albums, four EPs, two demo albums, one video album, and six music videos.

Carcass are regarded as pioneers within the grindcore genre. Their early work was also tagged as "splatter death metal", and "hardgore" on account of their morbid lyrics and gruesome album covers. They also became one of the pioneers of melodic death metal with their 1993 album Heartwork.

The band's lyrical themes often focus on animal rights issues and some members are vegetarians or vegans.
